## Release Process

### Release Preparation

1. **Create Release Branch**:
   - Branch from develop
   - Version number following semver
   - Freeze feature additions

2. **Stabilization**:
   - Complete testing
   - Fix release issues
   - Update documentation
   - Performance tuning

3. **Release Candidate**:
   - Deploy to staging
   - Conduct UAT
   - Fix critical issues
   - Prepare release notes

4. **Final Release**:
   - Merge to main
   - Tag with version
   - Deploy to production
   - Announce release

### Versioning Strategy

Follow Semantic Versioning (SemVer):
- **Major**: Incompatible API changes
- **Minor**: Backwards-compatible functionality
- **Patch**: Backwards-compatible bug fixes

Example: 2.3.1
- Major: 2
- Minor: 3
- Patch: 1

### Hotfix Process

1. Branch from main
2. Fix the issue
3. Test thoroughly
4. Merge to main and develop
5. Deploy to production
6. Update patch version

## DevOps Workflow

### Environment Strategy

- **Development**: For active development

### Continuous Deployment

1. **Development Deployment**:
   - Auto-deploy from develop
   - Run integration tests
   - Notify team of results

2. **Staging Deployment**:
   - Manual trigger from release branch
   - Run full test suite
   - Perform regression testing
   - Validate with stakeholders

3. **Production Deployment**:
   - Manual approval
   - Scheduled deployment window
   - Incremental rollout strategy
   - Monitoring for issues
