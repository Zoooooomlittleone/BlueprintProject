# Testing Strategy

## Testing Approach

This document outlines a comprehensive testing strategy for ensuring the quality, reliability, and performance of the system.

## Testing Levels

### Unit Testing
- **Scope**: Individual components, functions, and methods
- **Responsibility**: Developers
- **Tools**: JUnit, Jest, pytest
- **Automation**: Integrated into CI pipeline, runs on every commit
- **Coverage Target**: 80% code coverage minimum

#### Unit Testing Guidelines
- Test each function for expected behavior with normal inputs
- Test edge cases and boundary conditions
- Test error handling and exception paths
- Use mocks or stubs for external dependencies
- Ensure tests are independent and can run in any order

### Integration Testing
- **Scope**: Interaction between components and services
- **Responsibility**: Developers and QA engineers
- **Tools**: Postman, REST Assured, TestContainers
- **Automation**: Runs on feature branch completion and merges to develop

#### Integration Testing Guidelines
- Test API contracts between services
- Verify database interactions
- Test external system integrations
- Validate message handling between components
- Ensure proper error propagation

### System Testing
- **Scope**: End-to-end functionality of the entire system
- **Responsibility**: QA engineers
- **Tools**: Selenium, Cypress, JMeter
- **Automation**: Runs on merges to main branch and before releases

#### System Testing Guidelines
- Test complete user workflows
- Verify system configuration across environments
- Test data flows through the entire system
- Validate system behavior under various conditions
- Ensure all components work together correctly

### Performance Testing
- **Scope**: System performance under load and stress
- **Responsibility**: Performance engineers
- **Tools**: JMeter, Gatling, K6
- **Schedule**: Before major releases and after significant architecture changes

#### Performance Testing Types
- **Load Testing**: Verify behavior under expected load
- **Stress Testing**: Verify behavior under extreme load
- **Endurance Testing**: Verify behavior over extended periods
- **Spike Testing**: Verify behavior with sudden load increases
- **Scalability Testing**: Verify system scales as expected

### Security Testing
- **Scope**: System security and vulnerability assessment
- **Responsibility**: Security engineers
- **Tools**: OWASP ZAP, SonarQube, Snyk
- **Schedule**: Before major releases and quarterly security audits

#### Security Testing Areas
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Identify known vulnerabilities
- **Penetration Testing**: Attempt to exploit weaknesses
- **Security Code Review**: Identify security issues in code
- **Dependency Analysis**: Check for vulnerable dependencies
- **Compliance Verification**: Ensure adherence to security standards

## Test Environments

### Development Testing Environment
- Purpose: For developer testing during implementation
- Configuration: Mimics production with scaled-down resources
- Data: Anonymized subset of production-like data
- Access: Restricted to development team

### QA Testing Environment
- Purpose: For formal QA testing cycles
- Configuration: Matches production environment closely
- Data: Complete test dataset with all scenarios covered
- Access: Restricted to QA team and project stakeholders

### Staging Environment
- Purpose: Final verification before production deployment
- Configuration: Identical to production environment
- Data: Production-like data volume and variety
- Access: Restricted to QA leads and project managers

## Test Data Management

### Test Data Strategy
- Synthetic data generation for most test cases
- Anonymized production data for complex scenarios
- Data refresh process for maintaining test environments
- Database seeding scripts for consistent test setup

### Test Data Requirements
- Coverage of all business scenarios
- Edge cases and boundary conditions
- Error and exception scenarios
- Performance testing volume data
- Compliance with data protection regulations

## Test Automation

### Automation Framework
- Page object model for UI automation
- API test automation using contract-based approach
- BDD framework for business-focused tests
- Custom test reporters and dashboards

### Automation Pipeline
- Unit tests in developer workflow
- Integration tests in CI pipeline
- System tests in CD pipeline
- Nightly regression test suite
- Performance test scheduling

## Defect Management

### Defect Lifecycle
- Defect identification and reporting
- Triage and prioritization
- Assignment and resolution
- Verification and closure
- Trend analysis and reporting

### Defect Severity Classification
- **Critical**: System unavailable or major function unusable
- **High**: Significant impact, no workaround
- **Medium**: Moderate impact, workaround available
- **Low**: Minor impact, cosmetic issues

## Test Reporting

### Test Metrics
- Test coverage percentage
- Pass/fail rate
- Defect density
- Defect resolution time
- Automated test execution time

### Reporting Frequency
- Daily test execution reports
