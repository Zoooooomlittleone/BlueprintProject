## Acceptance Criteria Framework

Each user story should have specific acceptance criteria that define when the story is complete. Below is a framework for defining acceptance criteria:

### Format
```
Given [context]
When [action]
Then [expected result]
```

### Example
For the user story: "As an administrator, I want to create user accounts with specific roles so that I can control system access."

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Given I am logged in as an administrator
   When I navigate to user management
   Then I should see options to create, edit, and delete users
   
2. Given I am on the user creation screen
   When I enter valid user details and select a role
   Then a new user account should be created with the specified role
   
3. Given I have created a new user account
   When the user logs in for the first time
   Then they should be prompted to change their password
   
4. Given I am viewing the user list
   When I search for a user by name or email
   Then matching users should be displayed
   
5. Given I am editing a user
   When I change their role
   Then their permissions should be updated accordingly

## User Journey Maps

For each persona, detailed user journey maps should be created to visualize their interaction with the system. These maps should include:

1. **Stages**: Key phases of interaction (e.g., onboarding, daily use, troubleshooting)
2. **Actions**: What the user does at each stage
3. **Touchpoints**: System interfaces or features used
4. **Emotions**: User's emotional state during the journey
5. **Pain Points**: Challenges or frustrations encountered
6. **Opportunities**: Potential improvements to enhance the experience

## Prioritization Matrix

User stories should be prioritized based on:

1. **Business Value**: Impact on organizational goals
2. **User Value**: Importance to user experience
3. **Implementation Complexity**: Technical difficulty and resource requirements
4. **Dependencies**: Relationships with other features or stories

Priority categories:
- **Must Have**: Critical for system functionality
- **Should Have**: Important but not critical
- **Could Have**: Desirable but can be deferred
- **Won't Have**: Out of scope for current release

## Validation Approach

User stories and requirements should be validated through:

1. **Stakeholder Reviews**: Regular sessions with business stakeholders
2. **User Testing**: Sessions with representative users from each persona group
3. **Prototyping**: Low or high-fidelity prototypes to visualize solutions
4. **Iterative Feedback**: Continuous improvement based on implementation feedback

## Requirements Traceability

Each user story should be traceable to:

1. **Business Objectives**: How it supports organizational goals
2. **System Requirements**: Associated functional and non-functional requirements
3. **Design Elements**: UI/UX components and architectural elements
4. **Test Cases**: Validation methods to ensure proper implementation

This traceability ensures that all development efforts align with user needs and business objectives.
