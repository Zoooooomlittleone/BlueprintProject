# Requirements

This directory contains comprehensive requirements documentation for the Advanced System Blueprint project. These requirements serve as the foundation for all design, implementation, and testing activities.

## Document Overview

### [SystemRequirements.md](./SystemRequirements.md)

This document outlines the core functional and non-functional requirements for the system, including:

- Core system functions
- Performance requirements
- Security requirements
- Usability requirements
- Reliability requirements
- Maintainability requirements
- System constraints
- Success criteria

### [UserStories.md](./UserStories.md)

This document provides detailed user stories and personas to capture the system from the user perspective:

- User personas (Administrator, Power User, Regular User, External User, Mobile User)
- User stories organized by persona
- Acceptance criteria framework
- User journey maps
- Prioritization matrix
- Validation approach
- Requirements traceability

### [TechnicalRequirements.md](./TechnicalRequirements.md)

This document details the technical specifications and requirements for system implementation:

- System architecture requirements (scalability, availability, performance)
- Data management requirements
- Security requirements
- Integration requirements
- DevOps requirements
- User interface requirements
- Advanced feature requirements (AI/ML, Analytics, IoT, Blockchain, Edge Computing)
- Compliance requirements
- Performance criteria
- System constraints
- Implementation considerations
- Technical risks and mitigations

### [DataRequirements.md](./DataRequirements.md)

This document focuses on data-specific requirements across all aspects of the system:

- Data entities and relationships
- Data models (conceptual, logical, physical)
- Data quality requirements
- Data governance requirements
- Data integration requirements
- Data security requirements
- Analytical data requirements
- Data storage requirements
- Data migration requirements
- Advanced data requirements (AI/ML, IoT, Blockchain, Big Data)
- Data compliance requirements
- Data documentation requirements
- Implementation considerations

## Requirements Approach

Our requirements documentation follows these key principles:

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Addressing all aspects of the system from functional, technical, user, and data perspectives.

2. **Clear Traceability**: Establishing connections between business needs, user stories, and technical requirements.

3. **Measurable Criteria**: Defining specific, measurable acceptance criteria for validation.

4. **Practical Implementation**: Balancing ideal requirements with practical implementation considerations.

5. **Future Flexibility**: Designing requirements to support future growth and technology evolution.

## Using These Requirements

These requirements documents should be used in the following ways:

1. **Design Phase**: As the foundation for architecture and detailed design decisions.

2. **Implementation Planning**: For breaking down work into manageable components.

3. **Testing Strategy**: As the basis for test planning and acceptance criteria.

4. **Stakeholder Communication**: For aligning expectations with all project stakeholders.

5. **Change Management**: As the baseline against which to evaluate proposed changes.

## Requirements Maintenance

These requirements will be managed according to the following process:

1. Regular reviews to ensure continued relevance
2. Formal change control for modifications
3. Version tracking for all requirement documents
4. Impact analysis for proposed changes
5. Stakeholder approval for significant modifications

## Next Steps

1. Complete requirements validation with stakeholders
2. Develop detailed design specifications based on these requirements
3. Create implementation plans aligned with requirement priorities
4. Establish traceability matrix connecting requirements to design elements
5. Develop test plans covering all requirement areas
