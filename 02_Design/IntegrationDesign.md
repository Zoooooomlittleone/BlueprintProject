# Integration Design

## Integration Design Overview

This document details the comprehensive integration architecture for the system, covering APIs, service communication, event-driven architecture, and external system integration.

## Integration Principles

The integration architecture is guided by the following core principles:

1. **Loose Coupling**: Services and systems are independent and minimize direct dependencies
2. **Service Autonomy**: Each service owns its domain data and business logic
3. **Smart Endpoints, Dumb Pipes**: Business logic resides in services, not in integration layers
4. **Domain-Driven Design**: Service boundaries align with business domains
5. **Evolutionary Architecture**: Integration mechanisms support continuous change
6. **Defense in Depth**: Security at all integration points
7. **Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring and tracing across integration boundaries
