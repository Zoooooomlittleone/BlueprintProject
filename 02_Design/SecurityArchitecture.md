# Security Architecture

## Security Architecture Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive security architecture for the system, covering authentication, authorization, data protection, network security, monitoring, and compliance controls.

## Security Principles

The security architecture is guided by the following principles:

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls to protect against various attack vectors
2. **Least Privilege**: Access limited to the minimum necessary to perform required functions
3. **Secure by Default**: Security built in from the beginning rather than added later
4. **Zero Trust**: No implicit trust based on network location or asset ownership
5. **Privacy by Design**: Privacy protections integrated into all components and processes
6. **Fail Secure**: Systems default to a secure state during failures or exceptions
7. **Continuous Verification**: Ongoing validation of security controls and configurations

## Identity and Access Management
