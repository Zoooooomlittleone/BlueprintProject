# Data Architecture

## Data Architecture Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive data architecture for the system, covering data storage, access patterns, integration, and governance.

## Data Modeling

### Conceptual Data Model

The conceptual data model represents the high-level business entities and their relationships.

#### Core Business Entities

1. **User**
   - Represents system users with authentication and profile information
   - Contains identity, preferences, and system-specific metadata
   - Related to Organizations, Projects, and Tasks

2. **Organization**
   - Represents a business entity using the system
   - Contains hierarchical structure (departments, teams)
   - Relates to Users, Projects, and Resources

3. **Project**
   - Represents a collection of work activities
   - Contains timeline, status, and metadata
   - Relates to Tasks, Resources, and Documents

4. **Task**
   - Represents a unit of work
   - Contains assignment, status, and tracking information
   - Relates to Users (assignees) and Projects

5. **Document**
   - Represents structured or unstructured content
   - Contains metadata, versioning, and access control
   - Relates to Projects, Tasks, and Users

#### Entity Relationships

```
User (1) <----> (N) Organization (Membership)
Organization (1) <----> (N) Project (Ownership)
Project (1) <----> (N) Task (Composition)
User (1) <----> (N) Task (Assignment)
