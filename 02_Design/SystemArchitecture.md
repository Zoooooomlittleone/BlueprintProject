# System Architecture

## Architecture Overview

The system will follow a microservices architecture pattern to ensure scalability, maintainability, and resilience. This document outlines the high-level design of the system.

## System Components

### 1. Frontend Layer
- **Web Application**
  - Single Page Application (SPA) built with React
  - Responsive design using modern CSS frameworks
  - Component-based architecture
  - State management with Redux
  
- **Mobile Application**
  - Cross-platform development using React Native
  - Offline capabilities with local data synchronization
  - Push notification integration

### 2. API Gateway Layer
- Request routing
- Authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting
- Request/response transformation
- API documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger
- API versioning

### 3. Microservices Layer
- **User Service**
  - User registration and management
  - Authentication and authorization
  - Profile management
  
- **Data Processing Service**
  - Data ingestion
  - Transformation pipelines
  - Data validation
  - Processing orchestration
  
- **Analytics Service**
  - Report generation
  - Dashboard data providers
  - Data aggregation
  - Analytical processing
  
- **Notification Service**
  - Email notifications
  - Push notifications
  - Scheduled alerts
  - Notification preferences
  
- **Integration Service**
  - Third-party system connectors
  - Webhook management
  - Data import/export

### 4. Data Layer
- **Relational Database**
  - User data
  - Transactional data
  - Configuration data
  
- **NoSQL Database**
  - High-volume operational data
  - Document storage
  - Time-series data
  
- **Data Warehouse**
  - Historical data
  - Analytics datasets
  - Reporting data
  
- **Caching Layer**
  - Distributed cache
  - Session storage
  - Frequently accessed data

### 5. Infrastructure Layer
- **Container Orchestration**
  - Kubernetes for service management
  - Auto-scaling configurations
  - Service discovery
  
- **Messaging System**
  - Asynchronous communication
  - Event sourcing
  - Message queues
  
- **Monitoring and Logging**
  - Centralized logging
  - Application monitoring
  - Performance metrics
  - Alerting system
  
- **Security Infrastructure**
  - Identity management
  - Secret management
  - Certificate management
  - Network security

## System Patterns

### 1. Communication Patterns
- REST for synchronous API communication
- gRPC for high-performance internal service communication
- Event-driven architecture for asynchronous operations
- Publish-subscribe pattern for notifications

### 2. Data Patterns
- CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
- Event Sourcing for audit trails and history
- Data replication for availability
- Sharding for performance and scalability

### 3. Resilience Patterns
- Circuit Breaker pattern for failure handling
- Bulkhead pattern for isolation
- Retry pattern with exponential backoff
- Timeout pattern for unresponsive services

### 4. Deployment Patterns
- Blue-Green deployment
- Canary releases
- Feature toggles
- Infrastructure as Code

## Integration Points

### External Systems
- Authentication providers (OAuth, SAML)
- Payment processors
- Email service providers
- External data sources
- Partner APIs

### Internal Systems
- Existing enterprise systems
- Legacy databases
- Data warehouses
- Reporting tools

## Technical Decisions

### Programming Languages
- Backend: Java (Spring Boot), Node.js, Python
- Frontend: JavaScript/TypeScript (React)
- Infrastructure: Go for utilities

### Data Storage
- PostgreSQL for relational data
- MongoDB for document storage
- Redis for caching
- Elasticsearch for search functionality

### Infrastructure
- Kubernetes for container orchestration
- Docker for containerization
- Terraform for infrastructure as code
- AWS/Azure/GCP for cloud hosting

## Security Architecture
- JWT for authentication
- OAuth 2.0 for authorization
- TLS/SSL for data in transit
- AES-256 for data at rest
- Role-based access control
- API key management
